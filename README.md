### Hey there!

I am a simple old-school human being working as a software engineer. I love building new softwares, finding solutions to problems using existing tools, and just get fascinated by the awesomeness of the open source community. Just trying to do my part here.

When I am not working for a living, I am spending time writing [blogs](https://sandeep-krp.github.io) about the experiences I again working in my current org. Currently working on creating a [guide](https://sandeep-krp.github.io/terraform-examples) on terraform.

I am married to the love of my life who is having the 'real' fun while I keep staring at the screen.
